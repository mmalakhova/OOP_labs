[Chorus: Machine Gun Kelly]
Watch me take a good thing and fuck it all up in one night
Catch me, I'm the one on the run away from the headlights
No sleep, up all week, wasting time with people I don't like
I think something's fucking wrong with me

[Verse 1: Machine Gun Kelly]
Drown myself in alcohol, that shit never helps at all
I might say some stupid things tonight when you pick up this call
I've been hearing silence on the other side for way too long
I can taste it on my tongue, I can tell that something's wrong, but
I guess it's just my life and I can take it if I wanna
But I cannot hide in hills of California
Because these hills have eyes, and I got paranoia
I hurt myself sometimes, is that too scary for you?

[Chorus: Machine Gun Kelly with YUNGBLUD]
Watch me take a good thing and fuck it all up in one night
Catch me, I'm the one on the run away from the headlights
No sleep, up all week, wasting time with people I don't like
I think that something's fucking wrong with me

[Verse 2: YUNGBLUD]
Roll me up and smoke me, love
And we can fly into the night
Roll me up and smoke me, love
And we can fly into the night
You take drugs (Take drugs) to let go (Let go)
And figure it all out on your own
Take drugs (Take drugs) on gravestones (Gravestones)
To figure it all out on your own
[Chorus: Machine Gun Kelly & YUNGBLUD]
Watch me take a good thing and fuck it all up in one night
Catch me, I'm the one on the run away from the headlights
No sleep, up all week, wasting time with people I don't like
I think that something's fucking wrong with me

[Outro: YUNGBLUD & Machine Gun Kelly]
Find me alone at midnight
Inside my mind, tryna get things right
(Something's fucking wrong with me)
They want to keep you calling
So you don't wake in the morning
(Something's fucking wrong with me)
Goodnight, goodnight
Goodnight, goodnight, yeah (Goodnight)
Find me alone at midnight (Goodnight)
Inside my mind, tryna get things right (Goodnight)
They want to keep you calling (Goodnight)
So you don't wake in the morning
