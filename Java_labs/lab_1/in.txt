Standing now, in the mirror that I built myself
And I can't remember why the decision wasn't mine
But it seems I'm only clingin' to an idea now
Took my heart and sold it out to a vision that I wrote myself
And I don't wanna be somebody in America, just fighting the hysteria
I only wanna die someday
Someday, someday
When I burst into flames
I'll leave you the dust, my love
Hope a bit of it'll be enough to help remember the
Days when we came to this place
I told you I'd spill my guts, I left you to clean it up
I'm burstin' out of the
Seems like now it's impossible to work this out
I'm so committed to an old ghost town
Is it really that strange if I always want a change?
And if only the time and space between us wasn't lonely
I'd disintegrate into a thousand pieces
Think I'm makin' a mistake, but if I decide to break
Who will fill the empty space? Oh
And now, if I figure this out
Apart from my beatin' heart
It's a muscle, but it's still not strong enough to carry the
Weight of the choices I've made
I told you I'd ride this out
It's gettin' harder every day somehow
I'm burstin' out of myself
Too many guys think I'm a concept, or
I complete them, or I'm gonna make them alive
I'm just a fucked up girl who's lookin' for my own piece of mind
Don't assign me yours

I'd like to tell you that my sky's not blue, it's violent rain
And in my world, the people on the street don't know my name
In my world, I'm seven feet tall
And the boys always call, and the girls do too
Because in my world, I'm constantly, constantly havin' a breakthrough (hmm)
Or a breakdown, or a blackout
Would you make out with me underneath the shelter of the balcony?
'Cause I don't need anyone, I don't need anyone
I just need everyone and then some
I don't need anyone, I don't need anyone
I just need everyone and then some
Wish I could see what it's like to be the blood in my veins
Do the insides of all of my fingers still look the same?
And can you feel it too, when I am touchin' you?
And when my hair stands on ends, it's saluting you
The blush in your cheeks says that you bleed like me
And the 808 beat sends your heart to your feet
Left my shoes in the street so you'd carry me
Through a breakdown
Through a breakdown or a blackout
Would you make out with me on the floor of the mezzanine?
'Cause I don't need anyone, I don't need anyone
I just need everyone and then some
I don't need anyone, I don't need anyone
I just need everyone and then some
My face is full of spiderwebs, all tender yellow blue
And still with one eye open, well, all I see is you
I left my daydreams at the gate because I just can't take 'em too
Know my heart still has a suitcase, but I still can't take it through
I don't need anyone, I don't need anyone
I just need everyone and then some
I don't need anyone, I don't need anyone
I just need everyone and then some
I don't need anyone, I don't need anyone
I just need everyone and then some
Oh-mmm, oh-mmm, yeah

It's crazy when
The thing you love the most is the detriment
Let that sink in
You can think again
When the hand you wanna hold is a weapon and
You're nothin' but skin
Oh, 'cause I keep diggin' myself down deeper
I won't stop 'til I get where you are
I keep running, I keep running, I keep running
They say I may be making a mistake
I would've followed all the way, no matter how far
I know when you go down all your darkest roads
I would've followed all the way to the graveyard
Oh, 'cause I keep diggin' myself down deeper
I won't stop 'til I get where you are
I keep running when both my feet hurt
I won't stop 'til I get where you are
Oh, when you go down all your darkest roads
I would've followed all the way to the graveyard (no, oh)
You look at me (look at me)
With eyes so dark, don't know how you even see
You push right through me (push right through me)
It's gettin' real
You lock the door, you're drunk at the steering wheel
And I can't conceal
Oh, 'cause I've been diggin' myself down deeper
I won't stop 'til I get where you are
I keep running, I keep running, I keep running
They say I may be making a mistake
I would've followed all the way, no matter how far
I know when you go down all your darkest roads
I would've followed all the way to the graveyard
Oh, 'cause I keep diggin' myself down deeper
I won't stop 'til I get where you are
I keep running when both my feet hurt
I won't stop 'til I get where you are
Oh, when you go down all your darkest roads
I would've followed all the way to the graveyard
Oh, it's funny how
The warning signs can feel like they're butterflies
Oh, 'cause I keep diggin' myself down deeper
I won't stop 'til I get where you are
I keep running when both my feet hurt
I won't stop 'til I get where you are
Oh, when you go down all your darkest roads
I would've followed all the way to the graveyard

I wanna start this out and say
I gotta get it off my chest
Got no anger, got no malice
Just a little bit of regret
Know nobody else will tell you
So there's some things I gotta say
Gonna jot it down and then get it out
And then I'll be on my way
No, you're not half the man you think that you are
And you can't fill the hole inside of you with money, drugs and cars
I'm so glad I never ever had a baby with you
'Cause you can't love nothin' unless there's somethin' in it for you
Oh, I feel so sorry
I feel so sad
I tried to help you
It just made you mad
And I had no warnin'
About who you are
I'm just glad I made it out without breakin' down
And then ran so fuckin' far
That you would never ever touch me again
Won't see your alligator tears
'Cause, no, I've had enough of them
Let me start this off by sayin'
I really meant well from the start
Take a broken man right in my hands
And then put back all his parts
But you're not half the man you think that you are
And you can't fill the hole inside of you with money, girls and cars
I'm so glad I never ever had a baby with you
'Cause you can't love nothin' unless there's somethin' in it for you
Oh, I feel so sorry (I feel so sorry)
I feel so sad (I feel so sad)
I tried to help you (I tried to help you)
It just made you mad
And I had no warnin' (I had no warnin')
About who you are ('bout who you)
Just glad I made it out without breakin' down
Oh, I feel so sorry (I feel so sorry)
I feel so sad (I feel so sad)
I tried to help you (I tried to help you)
It just made you mad
And I had no warnin' (I had no)
About who you are ('bout who you)
'Bout who you are
Hey
Hey
Hey
Hey
'Cause you're not half the man you think that you are
And you can't fill the hole inside of you with money, drugs and cars
I'm so glad I never ever had a baby with you
'Cause you can't love nothin' unless there's somethin' in it for you
I feel so sad
You should be sad
You should be
You should be sad
You should be
You should be
You should be

Darling, I've just left the bar
And I've misplaced all my credit cards
My self-preservation and all of my reservations
Are sittin' and contemplatin' what to do with me, do with me
Think I took it way too far
And I'm stumblin' drunk, getting in a car
My insecurities are hurtin' me
Someone, please, come, and flirt with me
Really need a mirror that'll come along and tell me that I'm fine
I do it every time
I keep on hanging on the line, ignoring every warning sign
Come on, and make me feel alright again
'Cause it's 3:00 a.m.
And I'm callin' everybody that I know
And here we go again
While I'm runnin' through the numbers in my phone
And yeah, I'll take fake moans and dial tones
Let 'em spill right down the microphone
I need it digital 'cause, baby, when it's physical
I end up alone, end up alone
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
I need it digital 'cause, baby, when it's physical
I end up alone, end up alone
Every night, I wanna live in color through a white-blue screen
I got a technicolor vision going vivid in my light-blue jeans
I know it's complicated
'Cause everyone that I've dated says they hate it
'Cause they don't know what to do with me, do with me
Know that my identity's always getting the best of me
I'm the worst of my enemies
And I don't really know what to do with me
Yeah, I don't really know what to do with me
I keep on hanging on the line, ignoring every warning sign
Come on, and make me feel alright again
'Cause it's 3:00 a.m.
And I'm callin' everybody that I know
And here we go again
While I'm runnin' through the numbers in my phone
And yeah, I'll take fake moans and dial tones
Let 'em spill right down the microphone
I need it digital 'cause, baby, when it's physical
I end up alone, end up alone
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
I need it digital 'cause, baby, when it's physical
I end up alone, end up alone
I'm reckless, treat it like a necklace
Take a different version, and I try it
On for size with everybody that I know
And will you, please, pick up the fucking phone?
'Cause it's 3:00 a.m.
And I'm callin' everybody that I know
And here we go again
While I'm runnin' through the numbers in my phone
And yeah, I'll take fake moans and dial tones
Let 'em spill right down the microphone
I need it digital 'cause, baby, when it's physical
I end up alone, end up alone
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
I need it digital 'cause, baby, when it's physical
I end up alone

Found you when your heart was broke
I filled your cup until it overflowed
Took it so far to keep you close (keep you close)
I was afraid to leave you on your own
I said I'd catch you if you fall
And if they laugh, then fuck 'em all (all)
And then I got you off your knees
Put you right back on your feet
Just so you could take advantage of me
Tell me how's it feel sittin' up there
Feeling so high but too far away to hold me
You know I'm the one who put you up there
Name in the sky
Does it ever get lonely?
Thinking you could live without me
Thinking you could live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why (yeah, I don't know why)
Thinking you could live without me
Live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why (I don't know why, yeah yeah)
Gave love 'bout a hundred tries (hundred tries)
Just running from the demons in your mind
Then I took yours and made 'em mine (made 'em mine)
I didn't notice 'cause my love was blind
Said I'd catch you if you fall (fall)
And if they laugh, then fuck 'em all (all)
And then I got you off your knees
Put you right back on your feet
Just so you can take advantage of me
Tell me how's it feel sittin' up there
Feeling so high but too far away to hold me
You know I'm the one who put you up there
Name in the sky
Does it ever get lonely?
Thinking you could live without me
Thinking you could live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why (yeah, I don't know why)
Thinking you could live without me
Live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why, yeah
You don't have to say just what you did
I already know (I know)
I had to go and find out from them
So tell me how's it feel (oh-woah)
Tell me how's it feel sittin' up there
Feeling so high but too far away to hold me
You know I'm the one who put you up there
Name in the sky
Does it ever get lonely?
Thinking you could live without me
Thinking you could live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why (yeah, I don't know why)
